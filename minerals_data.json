The UV-Vis spectra show two zones of transmittance, in the red region at 650\u2013700 nm and the blue-green region at 460\u2013510 nm. The absorption bands of Cr<sup>3+</sup> and V3<sup>+</sup> at 574 nm in the UV-Vis spectra are the main cause of the change in colour.[[2]] \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThere are transition metal elements in garnet, and the main theory of its color formation is crystal field theory. Fe2+ and Mn2+ are the main color-causing ions in purple pyrope\u2013almandines, for Mg2+ is insignificant for the color of the samples. As an island silicate mineral, peridot\u2019s beautiful color is also caused by Fe2+. However, it is worth noting that the almandine\u2013skiagite\u2019s brownish yellow color is caused by the charge transfer between element ions. Spessartine\u2019s color is vivid orange. There are many research studies on the color causes and spectrum about spessartines; we find that the reason why spessartines appear a beautiful orange is not only the Mn2+ d-d electron transition, but also the valence charge transfer transition between Fe2+and Fe3+. They obviously absorb in the area of the blue-purple region, which makes the spessartines appear a bright color.\r\nAs one of the most promising colored gemstones on the market, spessartine is becoming increasingly popular. According to the CIE 1976 L*a*b*, the relationship between chroma C*, the h\u00b0 and colorate coordinates a* and b* was analyzed. The chemical composition was analyzed according to ED-XRF, then we quantitatively analyzed the impact of the elements FeOtot and MnO and the ratio FeOtot/MnO on color parameters L*, h\u00b0. By analyzing the UV-visible spectrum of spessartines, we find the color mechanism of the samples. It is worth noting that this article is the first to studied the relationship between the peaks\u2019 position in the infrared spectrum and the color parameters of spessartines. With the increase in MnO content, the A, C and D peaks in the infrared spectrum shifted from the region of high frequency to low frequency, the color parameters L* and h\u00b0 both increased, and the spessartines\u2019 color also changed from dark orange-red to bright orange.
